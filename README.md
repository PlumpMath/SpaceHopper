# SpaceHopper
Rhino/Grasshopper fun that deals with physical/virtual space

**RazerHydraObjectManipulation.gh**:

**Requirements**: Razer Hydra, the [Hydra-OSC](https://github.com/MrMormon/hydra-osc) executable

**Description**: This component lets you select objects (Breps, Meshes, Points, Surfaces) with your mouse; once selected, you can use the left controller (and a trigger) of the Razer Hydra to move and place it elsewhere in Rhino space.
