Fun with Rhino/Grasshopper components that deal with physical/virtual space

### RhinoLucidDreaming:

Video example: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wqPbEoHS_Y)

**Status**: Proof-of-concept (aka not-even-beta)

**Description **: 
RhinoLucidDreaming uses the Oculus and a workflow to simulate the creation of an immersive Rhino modeling environment in which 3d modeling will modify the space around you.

0. You sit at your desk, in front of a computer.
1. You put on your Oculus Rift. 
2. Your eyes adjust: you are sitting at a desk, in front of a computer. 
3. That computer is running Rhino. In that Rhino window, you see a 3d model of a person sitting at a desk, in front of a computer -- that person is you.
4. Any actions you take in Rhino then appear in 'your world'; placing a cube in front of the person in the 3d model subsequently places a cube in front of you. Placing a dome above the 3d-model-you places a dome above you. 
5. On your right, on the desk, is a small model of a miniature person sitting at a miniature desk, in front of a miniature computer.
6. Objects you model in Rhino also appear in that small model. Leaning over the table, you can peer into corners and scrutinize the details of that model.
7. If you wish, you can also crane your neck to your upper left, and realize that there is also a larger version of you, sitting at a desk, in front of a computer.

**Description**: This component lets you select objects (Breps, Meshes, Points, Surfaces) with your mouse; once selected, you can use the left controller (and the 'bumper' button on the controller) of the Razer Hydra to move and place it elsewhere in Rhino space.
